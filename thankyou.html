github is not authenticating with user name and passw0rd


If you're having trouble authenticating with your username and password on GitHub, it's because GitHub no longer supports password-based authentication for most Git operations. This change was implemented in August 2021 as a security measure.

Instead of a password, you need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT). Think of a PAT as a secure, temporary password created specifically for authenticating with Git. It's a much safer way to handle authentication because you can revoke it at any time and it's not tied to your main account password.

How to Fix It: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)
Here's how to generate and use a PAT to authenticate your Git operations:

Generate a PAT on GitHub:

Go to your GitHub account settings.

Navigate to Developer settings on the left sidebar.

Click on Personal access tokens and then Tokens (classic).

Click the Generate new token button and choose Generate new token (classic).

Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "My Laptop").

Set an expiration date.

Select the scopes (permissions) you need. For most common use cases, repo is sufficient.

Click Generate token.

IMPORTANT: Copy the token immediately! You won't be able to see it again. Treat it like a password.

Use the PAT to Authenticate:

When you're prompted for your password during a Git command (like git clone, git pull, or git push), use your username as the username and the PAT you just generated as the password.

Use a Credential Manager (Recommended):

For a more permanent solution, use a Git credential manager. This will store your PAT securely so you don't have to enter it every time.

For macOS: Git comes with a built-in credential helper that uses the Keychain. After you enter your PAT for the first time, it should be saved automatically.

For Windows: Install the Git Credential Manager Core. You can do this by selecting it during the Git for Windows installation or by using a package manager.

By switching from your password to a PAT, you'll resolve the authentication issue and improve the security of your GitHub account.






how to ceate git hub repos from cli?


The best way to create a GitHub repository from the command line is by using the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface). The gh command is the official tool for interacting with GitHub from your terminal and it's much simpler than using curl or other methods.

Using GitHub CLI
Install GitHub CLI: First, make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed. You can find instructions for your operating system on the official GitHub CLI website.

Authenticate: If you haven't already, you need to authenticate your CLI with your GitHub account. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

gh auth login

Create a Repository:

From an existing local repository: If you're in a directory that is already a Git repository (i.e., you've run git init), you can create a remote repository on GitHub and link it with a single command. The --public, --private, or --internal flags are required for non-interactive creation. For example, to create a public repo:

gh repo create <repository_name> --public

From scratch: If you want to create a new remote repository and clone it to your machine, you can use the --clone flag:

gh repo create <repository_name> --public --clone

The gh repo create command is highly versatile and offers many other options for adding a README, a .gitignore file, and more.

Manual Method (without GitHub CLI)
While the GitHub CLI is the recommended approach, you can still do this manually using standard Git commands, though it requires more steps.

Create a local Git repository: Navigate to your project directory and initialize it as a Git repository.
git init

Make your initial commit: Add your project files and commit them.
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Manually create the remote repository on GitHub: You need to go to the GitHub website and create a new, empty repository. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license. Once created, GitHub will provide you with the remote URL (e.g., ht
